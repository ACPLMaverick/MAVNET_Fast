General thingies:
+ Blinker API.
+ UART API.
+ Display API.
+ Check out timers and make sure they work correctly.
+ Make a performance measurement API using the last available timer.
- Create LIB out of existing components.
- Extract command buffer out of Display API.
- Make an interface to easily register timed functions, to prevent main thread from being sleeped.
- Thermometer API.
- Button API.
- Analog knob API.

Application:
Stage 1:
- Reading current temperature and displaying it.
- Displaying and setting the desired temperature.
- Turn ON/OFF AC pin based on the temperature difference.
- Think about how to connect AC pin to the real switch.
- Think about how to mount the system in place.

Stage 2:
- Button overrides for hot/cold knob and fan speed knob.
- Think about how to control knobs. Will any kind of engine be needed?
- Regulate output for hot/cold and fan speed knobs automatically.
